# Architecture, design choices and principles

This is the record of how Number Garden is built and why. Each section states the choice and the reason, so a change that goes against one of them is made knowingly.

## 1. Shape of the app

**One `index.html`, no build step, no framework.** Styles, markup and about 1,900 lines of plain JavaScript live in one file, next to a manifest, a service worker and an icon folder.

Why: the fastest possible loop is save-then-refresh, and there is exactly one file to publish anywhere (a static host, a chat artifact, an Electron or WebView2 shell). For a solo project of this size a bundler buys nothing visible.

When to change it: past roughly 5–10k lines, or when unit tests or a second developer arrive. The path that keeps the no-build property is to split into a few plain files (`engine.js`, `games.js`, `ideas.js`, `style.css`) loaded by script tags, with a five-line script that concatenates them back into a single file for single-file targets.

## 2. Runtime layout

The page is a set of **views**, one visible at a time, switched by `show(id)`: `home` (garden and doors), `play` (one problem), `done` (flower planted), `book`, `playground` and `toy`, `ideas` and `learn` (the picture books), `sheet` (grown-ups).

All state is one object `S`, persisted under the local-storage key `ng2` by `save()`:

| field | holds |
|---|---|
| `name`, `pro` | the child's name and pronouns (`she` / `he` / `they`) |
| `m` | per-game mastery `{lv, streak, low}` |
| `counts`, `last`, `days`, `stars`, `streakNow`, `bestStreak` | play history |
| `book`, `flowers`, `badges` | the rewards |
| `trail` | the current five stones `{door, steps, i, lit}` |
| `taught`, `recent` | lessons already shown; signatures of recent problems |
| `note`, `duo`, `family`, `savedAt` | grown-up settings, the family code, the write clock |

The child never sees levels or counts; they see flowers, the book and badges.

## 3. The game engine

Every game is one `skill({...})` registration:

```
skill({id, room, title, levels, idea?, grow?(lv), teach?(lv, lesson), mount(lv)})
```

`mount(lv)` draws into `stage` and `controls` using the shared widgets, and ends each problem by calling `win(message)` or `miss(hint)`. Every game also calls `help({book, clues, answer, why, show})`: `book` is the sentence written in the child's book, `clues` feed the Clue button (one per tap, each counting as a hint), `show` draws the answer for Show me, `why` is said with it. `reveal()` (Show me) ends the problem without a star and nudges mastery down.

Shared widgets: `pad` (number buttons), `numpad` (typed answer), `choices` (text or drawn options), `tenFrame`, `numberLine`, `clockSvg`, `gridSvg`, `coinBtn`, the story scene engine (`buildScene` / `actOut`, which animates what the child's answer would mean), and the drag engine (`trayOf`, `zones`, `makeDraggable`, `fullCount`).

**Mastery.** Three clean problems in a row move a game up a level; two hint-heavy problems move it down. `grow(lv)` optionally supplies the book line for a level-up.

**No repeats.** `play()` builds a signature of each problem (prompt plus stage) and keeps the last six per game; a repeat is re-rolled. Trails are built by `makeTrail(door)`.

**Pronouns.** `P()` returns the chosen set (`s`/`o`/`p`/`pp`/`self`), `vb(singular, plural)` picks the verb form, `cap()` capitalises. All child-facing text goes through these, so "they" reads "they have" and "do they need".

Generators over hand-written puzzles: Sudoku and Who has what? are parameterised generators that brute-force a unique solution, so a new variant is a level entry, not a new game. Which one is different? checks its reasons as number properties rather than storing sentences.

## 4. Trails and doors

A door starts a trail of **five stones from that door only**, cycling through the door's games with no two alike in a row; the no-repeat rule keeps a repeated game from showing the same problem. Earlier the trail borrowed a warm-up and a puzzle stone and swapped in any game not played for three days. That was sound tutoring and confusing play: the child chose Time and got sudoku. Pure doors won.

## 5. Teaching layers

Help is layered, cheapest first, and the child chooses:

1. **Clue**: one structural hint per tap.
2. **Show me**: the answer drawn and acted out; the problem ends.
3. **Watch**: the game's `teach(lv, lesson)`, a narrated animation in Pip's bubble (`lesson.say`, `lesson.scene`, `await lesson.wait(ms)`), shown automatically the first time the child meets that level (`S.taught`), ending in a **My turn** button, replayable any time. Tapping My turn early stops it cleanly.
4. **Learn**: the Big Idea named by the game (`idea:'ten'`), opened in place and returning to the same stone. On the second miss Pip offers it and the button glows.

Pip the ladybug is the single narrator everywhere: home greeting, lessons, picture books, the maker games. The child learns one voice.

## 5a. Tell Pip: bug reports a child can make

A **Tell Pip** button sits on the play card and in every picture book. It opens six big choices with no typing: *It got stuck*, *The answer is wrong*, *I don't get it*, *Too hard*, *Too easy*, *I love this one*. Pip thanks the child and says she will tell the gardeners; *Back to my puzzle* returns to the same problem. Each report is kept on the device (last twenty, listed in the grown-ups screen with sent / waiting) and posted to the `reports` collection with the plain REST API; a failed send is retried when the app comes back to the foreground. `tools/reports.sh` lists the reports, newest first. The "love" choice exists so the button is also a way to say something nice, which keeps a child willing to tap it.

## 6. Big Ideas

A Big Idea is a concept taught, not a game dressed up. Every book follows the same order, and *Even and odd* is the model:

1. the idea in one plain sentence;
2. the same idea in a picture;
3. a second and a third way to see it;
4. the pattern or rule stated outright;
5. the reason the rule works;
6. the traps a child actually falls into;
7. where they meet it in life;
8. practice with pictures, then practice without ("three in a row and you have it");
9. what it is the same as elsewhere in the garden.

Each is an entry in `IDEAS`: `title`, `line`, `strand`, `thing`, `door`, `book`, `pages` (each `{say, draw(scene)}`), and `tries()` returning `{q, kind:'choice'|'num', opts?, ans, draw, explain, show?}`; the try-its sample several kinds, not just the first picture. A page that fails to draw logs a warning rather than failing silently.

## 7. Progress and sync

**Local first.** Every change is written to local storage at once. The app works with no network at all.

**Family code.** A code is four plus four characters from an unambiguous alphabet (`K7PM-3QX2`), made by *New family*. Sync uses Firestore's plain REST API with `fetch`, no SDK: one document per code in `families/{code}` with two fields, `data` (the whole `S` as a JSON string) and `savedAt`.

- Push: 1.5 seconds after any change, serialised so writes never overlap.
- Pull: on open and whenever the app returns to the foreground.
- Resolution: the copy with the newer `savedAt` wins. A device with no progress adopts the family's garden if the family has one. Typing a code is not progress and does not touch `savedAt`, so joining never overwrites the family.
- A pull that lands mid-problem keeps the current game's mastery record; `win` and `reveal` tolerate a missing one.
- Offline, the status line says so and the local copy carries on.

**The chat-artifact copy.** The same file also runs as a published claude.ai artifact, where it uses that page's own cloud store (`claude.use('db')`). That sandbox blocks outbound requests, so the family code cannot sync from there; the two stores are independent. The static site is the primary home.

## 8. Hosting and install

GitHub Pages serves `master` as-is; every push deploys. The repository lives under an organisation so the address carries no personal name. `manifest.webmanifest` (standalone display, garden colours, icons) and `sw.js` (network-first for the page so updates arrive, cache fallback when offline, old caches cleared on activate) make *Add to Home Screen* a real install. The service worker registers only over `https` on a real site, so the file keeps working from disk and from the artifact page.

## 9. Security and privacy

- No accounts, no sign-in, no analytics, no server of our own. The only outbound call is the family sync.
- The Firebase web `apiKey` and `projectId` are in the source on purpose. The web key is a public identifier, present in the page source of every site that uses Firebase; it grants nothing by itself. Access is controlled by the Firestore rules: a client may read or write one `families/{code}` document whose nine-character code it knows, with only the two expected fields, and may not list or delete. Codes have about a trillion combinations and cannot be enumerated.
- The remaining exposure is junk writes under made-up codes. The project runs on the free plan with no payment method, so that cannot cost money, only pause syncing for a day at the quota. Two optional hardenings: restrict the key to the site's domain in the Google Cloud console, and cap the document size in the rules.
- What is stored per family: a child's first name (if entered), pronouns, game levels and counts, book lines, flowers and badges. Nothing else.
- **Tell Pip** reports (section 5a) carry the game, level, the words on screen, the time, the app version, the family code and the device type. No name.
- The repository contains no child's name, no family's name, no account handles. The default child name is a neutral nickname, "Sprout", until one is typed on the device; pronouns are a setting with a neutral option.
- Anyone forking the project uses their own Firebase project; the rules above are in the README.

## 10. Design principles

The rules the games are held to, in rough order of importance:

1. **No timers.** Speed is never rewarded; thinking is.
2. **A star is for finishing**, never for a first try. Mistakes cost nothing but a hint.
3. **Hints point at the structure, never an X.** "Count the empty boxes," not "wrong".
4. **Every game shows the idea, not just the answer.** A win acts the problem out; Show me draws it; Which one is different? demands a reason, not a pick.
5. **Teach before asking** where asking first would be unfair, and let the lesson be replayed.
6. **Levels are invisible and adaptive.** The child sees flowers; a grown-up can nudge.
7. **One thing on screen.** No tabs, no counters, nothing competing for a five-year-old's attention.
8. **Pure doors.** Choosing Time means Time.
9. **Distractors stay inside what the level teaches.** A level-1 clock offers o'clock and half past, not 12:05.
10. **The child's natural order of taps wins** over the programmer's. Tap the bead, then the paint pot; sort first, then say why. A worked example waits for *My turn*.
11. **Pictures must be honest.** No box ends with two dots; faded means "placed for you", never "the wrong colour"; the dime really is smaller than the nickel because that is the trap worth learning.
12. **Language is the child's.** "Adds 4", not "+4"; "90 minutes, 1 hour and a half"; every sentence in the chosen name and pronouns; read-aloud wherever there is reading.
13. **Celebration is rare and real.** Confetti for flowers, level-ups and streaks of five and ten; nothing punishes a broken streak.
14. **No repeats.** Not the same problem twice in six goes, not the same game on two neighbouring stones.

## 11. Testing

Nothing is published until it passes a headless run. The checks, all Playwright against the local file:

- a syntax check of the whole script (`new Function` on the extracted source);
- every game at every level, played clean and miss-then-recover, asserting a star, a book line and no console errors;
- every page of every Big Idea drawn, the interactive pages driven, every kind of try-it answered;
- trail construction for every door, many times, asserting no neighbouring repeats and no cross-door stones;
- two simulated devices against a mocked Firestore (join, win on each side, foreground refresh, offline), asserting the garden moves both ways and that joining never overwrites;
- screenshots at phone width for layout checks (rows that must not wrap, clocks side by side).

The scripts live in `tests/` (`tests/run.sh` runs them all; `tests/README.md` lists them).

## 12. Conventions

- The code is dense one-liners by design; a new game should read like its neighbours.
- Comments explain *why* (a trap, a rule, a child's behaviour), not what.
- Book lines are written in the child's name and past tense: "found half of 8".
- `grow(lv)` text tells the child what gets bigger at the new level.
- Every child-facing string goes through `P()` / `vb()` where a pronoun or its verb appears.
- Tool-generated changes to the big arrays (`IDEAS`, `TOYS`) are spliced by entry id and bounded to the array's closing bracket; one over-reach once deleted the mascot and the drag engine, caught by the tests before publish.
