# Number Garden

A single-file maths game for a five-year-old who already does procedural arithmetic and needs the other half: number sense, strategy, patterns, and puzzles with no procedure. Every answer comes with a picture of why, a ladybug named Pip teaches before she asks, and each finished trail plants a flower.

Play it at **https://playmaths.github.io/number-garden/**, or open `index.html` in any browser. On a phone or tablet use *Add to Home Screen*: the web manifest and service worker make it an installed app with its own icon that works offline.

**Progress** is saved in the device's browser straight away. A **family code** (grown-ups screen → *New family* on the first device, then type the code on the others) keeps one garden on every device through a small cloud database; the browser copy is the offline fallback and the newer copy always wins. No account, no sign-in, no analytics. Details in [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Rooms

| Room | Games | What it builds |
|---|---|---|
| Warm-ups | How many? · Make 10 · Which has more? | Subitizing, complements to 10/20/100, comparing groups and numbers and finding the difference |
| Add & take | Take away · Make a ten to add · Find the missing number | Place value (sticks of 10 that break), bridging through ten, missing-addend thinking |
| Patterns | What comes next? · Rule machine | Repeating and growing patterns, function machines |
| Puzzles | Balance it · Which one is different? · Make the money · Sudoku (shapes 4×4 → digits 4×4 → 6×6) · Number riddle · Who has what? (logic grid) · Sort by two things · If this, then that | Reasoning with no algorithm: the seed of competition maths |
| Stories | Story mystery · How many ways? | Reading-level word problems in one to two steps, and open questions with several right answers, up to finding every split and counting the ways |
| Shapes & space | Mirror it · Count the shapes · Fit the hole · Finish the mirror · Count the cubes | Spatial reasoning: reflections, shapes hidden inside shapes, matching a piece to a gap, completing a symmetric picture, counting cubes you cannot see |
| Time | What time is it? · How long until…? · Days and months | Reading the clock to five minutes, elapsed time by counting on, the week and the year going round |
| Measure | Parts of a whole · How long? · About how many? | Halves and quarters of shapes and of groups, measuring with units laid end to end, estimating against a box of 10 |
| (Name) makes it | You hide the number · You make the rule · You write the story · You make the pattern | The child sets the puzzle and the app solves it, sometimes wrongly on purpose, so the child checks the answer and says why |
| Playground | Counters and sticks · Number line walk · Balance scale | Free play with no questions: feel ten snapping into a stick, hop a sum along the line, load a scale and watch it tip |
| Big Ideas | **Numbers:** Counting on · Skip counting · Tens and ones · Bigger and smaller · Number neighbors **Adding and taking:** Making ten · How far apart · What = really means **Groups:** Even and odd · Double and half · Equal groups · Fair sharing **Patterns:** Rules and machines **Shapes:** Shapes and mirrors **Measure:** Money · Measuring **Time:** Reading the clock · Day and night · Why 24, 60 and 60? · A day on Mars · Before there were clocks · Why time is precious · What is time for? | Picture books of 10 to 14 pages narrated by Pip: the idea in a sentence, two or three ways to see it, the rule, why it works, the traps, where you meet it, practice with and without pictures, what it is the same as; then three try-its and a link to the game |

## How a session works

The home screen is the garden with its doors. Pip the ladybug bobs there and in the corner of the play card, jumps on a right answer and tilts her head on a miss. Tapping a door starts a **trail** of five stepping stones, all from that door (a door with fewer than five games cycles through them, never the same problem twice). Each solved stone lights up; the fifth plants a flower. Levels adapt silently and are never shown to the child.

On every problem the child has **Clue**, **Show me**, and, where the game has one, **Watch** (Pip's lesson for that level, shown automatically the first time) and **Learn** (the Big Idea behind the game, offered by Pip on the second miss).

**My Book** (or "(Name)'s Book" once a name is set) writes one sentence the child can read for every problem solved ("Sprout took 9 away from 23 and got 14"), a bigger entry for each level-up and finished trail, and holds the badge shelf.

The grown-up settings are behind the faint *for grown-ups* link at the bottom of the home screen: the child's name and pronouns, the family code, a note for the home screen, a take-turns mode, a level nudge for every game, and a short summary page: ideas read, strongest games, what needs a second look, the last five book lines.

**Tell Pip.** A button on every problem and every picture book lets the child report a bug with one tap: it got stuck, the answer is wrong, I don't get it, too hard, too easy, I love this one. Reports go to the family's database for the grown-ups to read (`tools/reports.sh`); the grown-ups screen lists the ones sent from the device.

In Stories, the dots warm-up and Count the shapes, the child can touch each object to count it; the touch adds a numbered badge. Stories, riddles, how-many-ways and every Big Idea have a *Read it to me* button (browser speech, where available). Every fourth clean win, a card asks the child to explain out loud how they knew before the next stone.

## Design rules

- One thing on screen at a time. No tabs, no counters, no level tags visible to the child.
- No timers anywhere. Speed is never rewarded.
- A star is earned for finishing a problem, not for a first-try answer.
- Wrong answers get a hint that points at the structure, never an X. The second miss offers the lesson.
- Every game shows the idea, not just the answer: Show me draws it, a win acts it out.
- Where asking first would be unfair, Pip teaches first (the Time games), and the lesson can be replayed.
- Levels adapt on their own: three clean problems in a row moves up, two hint-heavy problems moves down. A grown-up can nudge any level.
- The child's name and pronouns (she, he or they) are a setting; every story, hint and book line uses them, with verbs agreeing. Nothing in the code assumes a name or a gender.
- Take-turns mode alternates turns on the same games so the child watches an adult think out loud.
- Every finished trail plants a flower. Confetti is reserved for flowers, level-ups, and 5- and 10-in-a-row streaks. Streaks are celebrated, never punished, and there is no daily streak to break.
- The home screen greets the child by name with what they did last time and a rotating one-line motto; a grown-up can leave a note.

## Setting up your own copy

1. Fork the repository and turn on GitHub Pages (Settings → Pages → *Deploy from a branch*, `master`, root). The app works at once, saving progress on each device.
2. For the family code (one garden across devices), create a free Firebase project, enable Firestore, and put its `apiKey` and `projectId` in the `FIREBASE` constant near the top of the script in `index.html`. Then paste these rules in Firestore → Rules and publish:

```
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /families/{code} {
      allow read: if code.size() == 9;
      allow write: if code.size() == 9
                   && request.resource.data.keys().hasOnly(['data', 'savedAt']);
    }
  }
}
```

For the Tell Pip reports, add this block inside the same `match /databases/{database}/documents {` before its closing brace:

```
    match /reports/{id} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow create: if request.resource.data.keys().hasOnly(['kind','label','game','level','prompt','stage','controls','when','ver','family','device','lang'])
                    && request.resource.data.prompt.size() < 400
                    && request.resource.data.stage.size() < 400
                    && request.resource.data.controls.size() < 300;
    }
```

The Firebase web key is a public identifier, not a secret; these rules are the access control (see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md#security-and-privacy)).
